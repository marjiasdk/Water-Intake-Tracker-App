## Water Intake Tracker App
This web application was made for the CFG Introduction To JavaScript course. The topic assigned to me was 'Health' and I created a water intake tracker web application to reflect the nature of the topic.

## Features
* Add glasses of water
* Set goals for water intake
* Progress bar to see how far along the user is in reaching their goal
* Reset the list of times where water was consumed
